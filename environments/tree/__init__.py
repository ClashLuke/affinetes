"""Tree Deduction Environment.

Deduce a tree's structure from partial observations.

Parameters:
    n: Number of nodes
    reveal_fraction: Fraction of edges revealed (0 = hard, 1 = trivial)

Usage:
    from tree import Actor

    actor = Actor()
    result = await actor.evaluate_deduction(
        n=8,
        reveal_fraction=0.5,
        task_id=42
    )
